# Earthquake Vulnerability Map

## 1. Introduction
The entirety of British Columbia's south coast experiences frequent seismic activity as it sits on top of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, where the Juan de Fuca plate subducts beneath the North American plate. As it is a hotspot for seismic activity, residents of the area usually hear about "The Big One", a magnitude 9.0 earthquake projected to happen at some point, whenever an earthquake is felt. Even if it isn't 'The Big One' earthquakes are a credible threat to public safety and it is important that we are constantly improving our preparedness in case of an emergency.

Also important is identifying vulnerable areas, where people might be more at risk of suffering severe consequences should an earthquake occur. We have identified several factors that might lead to populations being more vulnerable to earthquakes, and have generated a map scoring these factors via an Analytic Heirarchy Process(AHP), to perform a Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis(MCDA), identifying areas where the residents are more or less vulnerable in case of an earthquake emergency scenario.

### Factors:
